## What should I know before I get started

Klifu is fairly small open source project - it's made up of [3 repositories](https://github/klifu). When you initially consider contributing to klifu, you might be unsure about which of these 3 repositories implements the functionality you want to change, or report a bug for. This section should help you with that. 

As of now **klifu** is divided into 3 main repositories, 

- [@klifu/core](https://github.com/Klifu/core) -  where lives all the game logic and static data. 
- [@klifu/cli](https://github.com/klifu/cli) - the CLI client for klifu, as of now this is the only way to play klifu. 
- [@klifu/api](https://github.com/klifu/API) - klifu API which hosts all static data for the game.
