## Introduction
Klifu is an online pokemon turn based game influenced by pokemongo and pokemon red. Klifu aims to build the core game logic which could be used to create any client.

## Installation 
We are working to bring new clients to play this game, as of now we only have one. 

### `CLI`
To run `@klifu/cli`, ensure that you have Nodejs >=v10. [Install Nodejs via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

```
$ npm install -g @klifu/cli
```
This installs `@klifu/cli` globally on your system allowing you to run it from anywhere.
