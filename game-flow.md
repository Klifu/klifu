# Klifu Game Flow 

> As of now klifu supports only **gen1**.

## Introduction 
This document is the complete game flow of klifu. We will talk about all the rules and the game logic that is being used to build the game. Building klifu, we have taken inspiration from pokemongo and pokemon red, the two seperate but extremely popular. You will find a lot of similarities in the game. The complete game logic is built on typescript and you can check it [here](https://github.com/klifu/core). 


> Before diving into the game flow, I would like to clarify that the [core](https://github.com/klifu/core) library only deals with the game logic and not with storing game progress.

## Getting Started
Just like any other pokemon game, you start klifu by choosing your starter pokemon. You get a choice between `Bulbasaur`, `Charmander`, `Squirtle`. Your started pokemon is very crucial as you need it to catch new wild pokemons.
